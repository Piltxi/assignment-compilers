# Languages and Compilers Course Assignments

This repository contains assignments for the Languages and Compilers course at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. Each subdirectory represents a distinct assignment, showcasing various aspects of compiler design and optimization techniques using LLVM.

## Repository Structure

- [`Assignment1/`](Assignment1/) - Local Optimization Passes for LLVM's `opt` tool. Implements Algebraic Identity Optimization, Strength Reduction, and Multi-Instruction Optimization. [See README](Assignment1/README.md)
- [`Assignment2/`](Assignment2/) - Exercise and notions on `very busy expression`, `dominator analysis` and `constant propagation`
- [`Assignment3/`](Assignment3/) - Loop Optimization Pass for LLVM's `opt` tool. Implements Loop Invariant Code Motion. [See README](Assignment3/README.md)
